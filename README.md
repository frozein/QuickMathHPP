# QuickMathHPP

A single header, cross-platform, simple math library in under 2000 LOC. Contains common matrix, vector, and quaternion related functions used for graphics/games programming. This is a C++ port of my [QuickMath](https://github.com/frozein/QuickMath) library, adding convenience features such as operator overloading.

### Features
- Vector, matrix, and quaternion arithmetic functions
- Transformation/projection/view matrix functions
- SIMD-optimized functions (SSE3 instruction set, able to be disabled)
- Changeable function prefixes
